Prior to recommending changes please:

      2. If you are currently a member of GA4GH and in what capacity
      3. If you are currently using an implementation of Passports
      4. Whether you are recommending the change on behalf of one or more of the following: 
          * an implementation of the spec  
          * the Passports specification itself  
          * or other documentation in the researcher_ids directory  
      5. A full description of the recommendation you are making
      
A maintainer will get back to you shortly and may elect to raise your recommendation at the next Passports work stream meeting which typically occur every 6 weeks.
